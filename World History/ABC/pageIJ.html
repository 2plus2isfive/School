            Italy was an Axis power in World War II. They were allied with Nazi Germany and Japan. They wanted to create a modern
            Roman Empire, however they were unsuccessful and surrendered to the Allies in 1943.

            Japan during World War II was actually insane. Some of the things that they did to people I can't even say on here
            since this is a school assignment. The suffering that they put people through I think I would only wish upon Hitler
            himself. Horrible stuff.
